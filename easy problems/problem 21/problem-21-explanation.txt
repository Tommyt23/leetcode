the approach i had taken in order to complete this problem was making use of the process behind merge sort

first you need to check if either list is empty as if either one is empty the other list can just be returned as that list is already sorted

next using the logic behind a merge sort break each of the lists down into halves until each list has a length of 1
then compare each of the first item in two of the arrays and recursivly sort each list until you only have 1 list 

if done correctly you do not need to worry about ordering it at this point as merge sort algorithms will sort the list as they merge the two lists

using this method i got a speed of 21ms and 13.3mb
