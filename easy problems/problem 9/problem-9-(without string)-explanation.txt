in order to check if the value is a palindrome you would need to create a variable to store the reversed value this can be set at 0 to begin with.

1. in order to reverse the value you need to find the digit value of the original number which can be found by using modulus.

2. next you would need to multiply the reversed value by 10 whilst adding the digit to the valueand then add the digit value to the reversed value .

3. you need to divide the original value by 10 in order to be able to find the next value in the number.

these three steps would need to be replaced until the original value is equal to 0

once this has occured you can then return the reversed value.
