as always check if the list is empty. if the list is empty you can return the list as is

next you need a counter that records how many items are in the new array

in order to find out if the list already has the same value in the new list loop through the original list.
for each item in the list check if the item is in the new list.
the problem requires for the new list to be in the original list thus by making the original list equate to the new list it should be sufficient.
