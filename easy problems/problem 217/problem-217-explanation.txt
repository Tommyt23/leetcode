for this problem i used pythons built in function set in order to create a list of nums values without duplicates

if you only use set then the list will look like: set([1,2,3])
if used in combination with the list function it will look like a normal list

in order to check if there is any difference the easiest way would be in order to check the length of the lists if the length of the lists are different then there is multiples in the list
at which point we can then return true
