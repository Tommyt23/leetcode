with python there are built in methods that allow you to find the index of a value in a list.

if the value is not found then it will return a ValueError.
making use of try and except conditions you are able to add the value to the list. 
by using pythons sort method that sorts the list this will keep the time complexity under the required O(log n)
you can then repeat the use of the index method and return the output value.

using this method i got a speed of 45ms and 17.1mb
