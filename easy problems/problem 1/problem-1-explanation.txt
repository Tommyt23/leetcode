using nested loops, loop through each of the values in the list. inside the nested loops add the two items related to the nested loop if the two values equate to the target value then check if their index value is the same if not then return the index of the two values that are equal to the target value.


this is the first example that leetcode gives you:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

for this example this way the first numbers that would be added together is 2 and 2 this equals 4 and thus would not equal to the target and thus it would move on to the next value in the list.

next would be 2 and 7 this does equal 9 so it would then have to check if the index is the same. this would be false and thus it would then return the two index values to the terminal.
this should allow the user to produce correct test values.
